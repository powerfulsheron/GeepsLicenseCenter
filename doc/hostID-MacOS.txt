MacOS

For MacOS, the Host ID is the MAC address of the en0 device.

To obtain the MAC address of the en0 device, start by opening a Terminal window:

    Open Finder
    Open the "Applications" folder
    Open the "Utilities" folder
    Start the "Terminal" application

In the Terminal window, enter the following command:

ifconfig en0 | grep ether

The MAC address is the value listed next to "ether".
